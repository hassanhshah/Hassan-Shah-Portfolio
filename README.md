# Past Projects  

# [AgentAI (Streamlit GPT Chatbot with Context)](https://github.com/hassanhshah/GPTChatbot)
* Built a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT API with attention and personal assistant capabilities 
* Chatbot can be customized to fulfill specific personal use cases and call other APIs
* In the example below, AgentAI calls a flight API that looks for tickets, acting as a Travel Agent

# [COVID Vaccine Sentiment and Time Series Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanhshah/covid-vaccine-sentiment-and-time-series-analysis)
* Used natural language processing to analyze sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter (200,000+ Tweets)  
* Identified key themes in the discourse around vaccines, such as safety, efficacy, and social responsibility
* Created a time series analysis of vaccine sentiment over time, which showed a significant increase in positive sentiment following the rollout of vaccines
