# Past Projects  


# [COVID Vaccine Sentiment and Time Series Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanhshah/covid-vaccine-sentiment-and-time-series-analysis)
* Used natural language processing to analyze sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter (200,000+ Tweets)  
* Identified key themes in the discourse around vaccines, such as safety, efficacy, and social responsibility
* Created a time series analysis of vaccine sentiment over time, which showed a significant increase in positive sentiment following the rollout of vaccines

# [Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanhshah/heart-disease-eda-classification-90-accuracy)
* Performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset of heart disease patient records from the UCI Machine Learning Repository  
* Identified the most common risk factors for heart disease, which were chest pain type, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy, and sex (1 = male; 0 = female)  
* Compared accuracy of multiple types of ML models with Stacking CV Classifier reaching 90% prediction accuracy
