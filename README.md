# COVID Vaccine Sentiment and Time Series Analysis
* Used natural language processing to analyze sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter (200,000+ Tweets).
* Identified key themes in the discourse around vaccines, such as safety, efficacy, and social responsibility.
* Created a time series analysis of vaccine sentiment over time, which showed a significant increase in positive sentiment following the rollout of vaccines.
